# youtube-top-5
A quick display of your top 5 YouTube channels using your HTML watch history data from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).

Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, this code will give you two 1080x1920px jpgs with your top viewed YouTube channels, and a pandas dataframe that is a great start for further analysis.

<sub>Note: It would have been easier to parse this from the JSON format I didn't realize one could request from Google Takeout instead of of HTML, but hey, I got some BeautifulSoup practice.</sub>
